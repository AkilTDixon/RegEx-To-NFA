This is a work in progress

Currently functions for all complex test cases. Currently has a minimal GUI that takes a user inputted regex string, and outputs a PNG image of the end result minimized DFA to the window

Next is separating the functions to create NFAs, convert to DFA, and minimize DFAs into buttons, and display them depending on context of the automata.


Uses Graphviz for image output

Uses wxWidgets for the GUI
