This is a work in progress. Once the backend is completed to my satisfaction, I am considering trying to make a GUI

Currently functions for all complex test cases. Can print a .dgml file that shows the automata structure in visual studio.

Next is trying to make the automata output as an image file, and then start on a GUI
